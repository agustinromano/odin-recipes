    <h3>Desciption</h3>
    <p>Simple and healthy</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A couple handfuls of arugula (about 1 ½ cups)</li>
      <li>Drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>Lighter drizzle of thick balsamic vinegar or balsamic glaze*</li>
      <li>Optional: Light sprinkle of finely grated aged cheese, such as Parmesan or even cheddar</li>
      <li>Small pinch of flaky sea salt, kosher salt or fine salt</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper or pinch of red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
          <li>Add a couple handfuls of arugula to a bowl or small plate. Drizzle lightly with olive oil, followed by a lighter drizzle of balsamic vinegar (the ratio is really up to you—balsamic is sweeter than most other vinegars, so you might enjoy equal parts vinegar and oil).</li>
          <li>Sprinkle with cheese, if desired. Sprinkle with a small pinch of flaky sea salt, crushing it between your fingers as you sprinkle, or other salt (use a little more salt if not using cheese, which is salty).</li>
          <li>Finish the salad with a couple twists of freshly ground black pepper or a small pinch of red pepper flakes. Repeat for additional salads, if needed. Enjoy promptly, as the salad will wilt over time.</li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
